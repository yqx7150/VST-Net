# VST-Net
The Code is created based on the method described in the following paper:

## Introduction 
Inspired by the traditional VST scheme, we propose a novel Poisson denoising model based on convolutional neural network, called variance-stabilizing transform network (VST-Net). VST-Net inherits the structures and strengths of the traditional VST scheme via optimizing the nonlinear transformation by means of network design and supervised learning. The whole VST-Net network contains three sub-networks. The first and third sub-networks simulate the forward and inverse Anscombe transforms, respectively. Meanwhile, the second sub-network is devoted to playing the role of approximate Gaussian denoising. Joint learning strategy and two-stage progressive learning strategy are exploited to investigate the rationality and strength of the VST scheme.

The network architecture of the proposed VST-Net. It consists of three major components: SubNet1, SubNet2 and SubNet3. “C”, “B” and “R” stand for the Conv, BN and ReLU layers, respectively. For visual convenience, only one image from the 32 feature maps/images in the output of SubNet1 and SubNet2 is shown.
